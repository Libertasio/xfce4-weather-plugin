Here is a collection of ideas and tasks for future releases, listed in
categories, but not prioritized or mandatory.

Panel widgets
======================================================================
* Optionally hide scrollbox
* Use multiple lines in scrollbox
* Allow choosing a custom text color for the scrollbox widget to
  prevent unreadable or hardly readable text with some themes
* Use the Xfce hvbox (maybe, need to check)
* Support custom icon themes

Data
======================================================================
* Use HTTP status codes to warn in time about API changes
* How about a "follow-me" mode: Auto-determine location
  based on IP address and adapt to any changes?
* The plugin uses the local time, which results in wrong forecasts
  when the user chooses a location in a different timezone. It should
  be possible to find the timezone of the chosen location and do some
  math to correct this.
* Find acceptable provider (regarding availability and license of
  data) for live values, or alternatively maybe cache data for "fake"
  (e.g. interpolated) live values?
* Optimize data download update intervals. Current update interval is
  3 hours, but in fact data change more often. Updating data currently
  deletes point data at the beginning of the nearest available
  interval (because it is not provided by the XML document), so only
  temperature at the end of the interval could be shown with a higher
  update frequency. Caching/special treatment could solve this
  problem.

Forecast tab
======================================================================
* Show more details for daytime forecasts
  - maybe tooltips for each entry?
  - find a good way to indicate amount of precipitation

Details tab
======================================================================


Configuration dialog
======================================================================
* Reorganize options, the window's already too large for the small
  screen size of netbooks
* Apply options immediately, like in most Xfce apps
* Allow editing latitude and longitude

New stuff
======================================================================
* Graph tab showing hourly break-down of forecast data
