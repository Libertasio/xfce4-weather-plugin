* Get sunrise/sunset times via webservice
  - get rid of the hardcoded values
* Fetch logo from website (code is still there)
* More information in tooltip
  - currently only location and description are shown
  - could optionally replace scrollbox
* Better tooltips in config dialog
* Better organisation of options in config dialog
  - it's already too large for netbooks
* Apply options immediately, like in most xfce apps
* Don't complain about proxy settings on closing the config
  dialog when none are entered
* Further reduce calls to download data
  - maybe use data in XML to schedule downloads?
* More details in forecast window
  - maybe tooltips for each entry?
  - somehow indicate amount of precipitation
* Use the Xfce hvbox (maybe, need to check)
* Use multiple lines in scrollbox
* Use met.no RSS feed to warn in time about API changes
