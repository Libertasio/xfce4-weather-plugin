Here is a collection of ideas and tasks for future releases, listed in
categories, but not prioritized or mandatory.

Panel widget
======================================================================
* Optionally hide scrollbox
* Use multiple lines in scrollbox
* Use the Xfce hvbox (maybe, need to check)

Data
======================================================================
* Use HTTP status codes to warn in time about API changes
* Further reduce HTTP requests fetching data
  - maybe use data in XML to schedule downloads?
* How about a "follow-me" mode: Auto-determine location
  based on IP address and adapt to any changes?
* The plugin uses the local time, which results in wrong forecasts
  when the user chooses a location in a different timezone. It should
  be possible to find the timezone of the chosen location and do some
  math to correct this.
* Find acceptable provider (regarding availability and license of
  data) for live values or maybe cache data for "fake" (interpolated)
  live values?

Forecast tab
======================================================================
* Show more details for daytime forecasts
  - maybe tooltips for each entry?
  - find a good way to indicate amount of precipitation

Details tab
======================================================================


Configuration dialog
======================================================================
* Show longitude and latitude, allow entering them
* Reorganize options, the window's already to large
  for the small screen size of netbooks
* Apply options immediately, like in most xfce apps
* Don't complain about proxy settings on closing the dialog window
  when none are entered

New stuff
======================================================================
* Graph tab showing hourly break-down of forecast data
