Here is a collection of ideas and tasks for future releases, listed in
categories, but not prioritized or mandatory.

Maintenance and optimizing stuff
======================================================================
* Use upower for power saving mode (e.g. stop scrollbox animations).

Data
======================================================================
* Use HTTP status codes to warn in time about API changes.
  -> already reported in panel output, maybe in details tab too?
* Use XML "next run" to schedule data downloads.
* Use openweathermap.org for live/historical data when it is a bit
  more developed. Maybe check it again in a year or so, or wait until
  other (open) providers pop up. For the time being, met.no should be
  good enough. Other providers are only slightly better, like
  weather.com returning values that have been reported half an hour
  up to an hour in the past, depending on the location.
  Alternatively, implement METAR support (bug #9309).
* Download and cache astronomical data for several days. Easy to do,
  since the met.no sunrise API supports ranges.
* Find out how to calculate symbols by ourselves.

Icon themes
======================================================================
* Support icons for polar days, as met.no does.

Configuration dialog
======================================================================

Forecast tab
======================================================================
* Show day min/max values.

Details tab
======================================================================
* Maybe show logos of the other organisations too, not only met.no.

New stuff
======================================================================
* Graph tab showing hourly break-down of forecast data.
