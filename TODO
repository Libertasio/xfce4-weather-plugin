Here is a collection of ideas and tasks for future releases, listed in
categories, but not prioritized or mandatory.

Data
======================================================================
* Use HTTP status codes to warn in time about API changes.
  -> already reported in panel output, maybe in details tab too?
* Use XML "next run" to schedule data downloads.
* Download and cache astronomical data for several days. Easy to do,
  since the met.no sunrise API supports ranges.
* While met.no is a good forecast provider, it might be better to use
  another free and non-commercial provider for the current weather.
  Viable candidates:
  - openweathermap.org: could be developed a bit more, so check it
    again in a year or so
  - find a METAR provider (bug #9309)
* Find out how to calculate symbols by ourselves.

Widget and icons
======================================================================
* Support icons for polar days.
* Add option to set icon always small and next to the scrollbox
  (useful in deskbar mode).

Summary window
======================================================================
* Find a better name for the "Summary" window.
* Add new graph tab showing hourly break-down of forecast data.
* Add day/night max values (in red/blue font color).
* Add forecasts per day.
