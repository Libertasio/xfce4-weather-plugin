Here is a collection of ideas and tasks for future releases, listed in
categories, but not prioritized.

Panel widget
======================================================================
* More information in tooltip
  - currently only location and description are shown
  - could optionally replace scrollbox
* Use multiple lines in scrollbox
* Use the Xfce hvbox (maybe, need to check)

Data
======================================================================
* Get sunrise/sunset times via met.no webservice
  - see http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/sunrise/1.0/documentation
* Use met.no RSS feed to warn in time about API changes
* Further reduce HTTP requests fetching data
  - maybe use data in XML to schedule downloads?
* How about a "follow-me" mode: Auto-determine location
  based on IP address and adapt to any changes?

Forecast tab
======================================================================
* More details in forecast window
  - maybe tooltips for each entry?
  - somehow indicate amount of precipitation

Details tab
======================================================================
* Show sunrise and sunset times

Configuration dialog
======================================================================
* Show longitude and latitude, allow entering them
* Add tooltips where necessary and make the existing ones more
  descriptive
* Reorganize options, the window's already to large
  for the small screen size of netbooks
* Apply options immediately, like in most xfce apps
* Don't complain about proxy settings on closing the dialog window
  when none are entered
