DEBUGGING AND REPORTING BUGS
==========================================================================
Before reporting bugs or asking for new features, please consolidate
the Xfce bug tracker at https://bugzilla.xfce.org and check the TODO
file, because your issue or request might have been reported already
or be in planning. However, feel free to add any information not yet
mentioned that you find useful.

If you encounter problems like crashes or weird behaviour, it might
prove insightful to enable panel debugging as follows:

1) Quit the current running panel instance using 'xfce4-panel -q'.
2) Set the PANEL_DEBUG environment variable to 'weather' or 'all':
   export PANEL_DEBUG=weather
3) Start the panel and let it write its output to a file, e.g.:
   xfce4-panel > panel.log 2>&1 & disown
4) Watch output using tail -f or less or whatever you like:
   tail -f panel.log

This will make the plugin explain what it's currently doing and dump
data it downloaded from the various sources. More information about
debugging panel plugins can be obtained from several pages of the Xfce
Wiki at https://wiki.xfce.org.

It's also relatively easy and often very helpful to create a backtrace
using gdb or any other debugger should the plugin crash:

1) Find the process ID of the weather plugin with something like
   'pgrep -f libweather.so'. Let's assume the resulting PID is 1234.
2) Attach the GNU debugger to that process: 'gdb attach 1234'.
3) The plugin will be frozen now. Tell the debugger to let it continue
   with the 'cont' command.
4) Produce the crash if possible, or wait until it crashes.
5) GDB will detect the crash and freeze the plugin again. Use 'bt' to
   print a nice backtrace. Report the issue to the Xfce bugtracker at
   https://bugzilla.xfce.org, providing the backtrace.
6) 'quit' exits the debugger.
