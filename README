XFCE4-WEATHER-PLUGIN
==========================================================================
You can always find up-to-date information at the plugin homepage:

ABOUT
==========================================================================
Originally written by Bob SchlÃ¤rmann, this panel plugin shows
information about your local weather in the panel, using forecast data
provided by met.no.


USAGE
==========================================================================
The first time you open the configuration dialog, the weather plugin
automatically configures itself to fetch weather data from a place
which should be near you - based on your IP address.

You can change this location using the Change... button, and searching
for the city, country, address, monument etc. you're interested
in. Only latitude and longitude will be used for the data requests, so
you can edit the location name to something you like.

In this configuration screen, you can also choose which information
you want visible in the panel.

On the panel icon, a middle click forces an update, left click brings
up a forecast and details page. Right-clicking opens the contextual
menu.


MET.NO API DOCUMENTATION
==========================================================================
To get a quick overview, please consolidate the met.no API weather
documentation and especially their FAQ, which answers some questions
left open by the former:

* General documentation and data licensing
  http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/documentation
  http://api.yr.no/faq.html
  http://api.met.no/license_data.html

* Service-specific documentation
  http://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecastlts/1.1/documentation
  http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/sunrise/1.0/documentation

For more technical details you might need to study the XML schema
corresponding to the document in question.


DEBUGGING AND REPORTING BUGS
==========================================================================
Before reporting bugs or asking for new features, please consolidate
the Xfce bug tracker at https://bugzilla.xfce.org and check the TODO
file, because your issue or request might have been reported already
or be in planning. However, feel free to add any information not yet
mentioned that you find useful.

If you encounter problems like crashes or weird behaviour, it might
prove insightful to enable panel debugging as follows:

1) Quit the current running panel instance using 'xfce4-panel -q'.
2) Set the PANEL_DEBUG environment variable to 'weather' or 'all':
   export PANEL_DEBUG=weather
3) Start the panel and let it write its output to a file, e.g.:
   xfce4-panel > panel.log 2>&1 & disown
4) Watch output using tail -f or less or whatever you like:
   tail -f panel.log

This will make the plugin explain what it's currently doing and dump
data it downloaded from the various sources. More information about
debugging panel plugins can be obtained from several pages of the Xfce
Wiki at https://wiki.xfce.org.

It's also relatively easy and often very helpful to create a backtrace
using gdb or any other debugger should the plugin crash:

1) Find the process ID of the weather plugin with something like
   'pgrep -f libweather.so'. Let's assume the resulting PID is 1234.
2) Attach the GNU debugger to that process: 'gdb attach 1234'.
3) The plugin will be frozen now. Tell the debugger to let it continue
   with the 'cont' command.
4) Produce the crash if possible, or wait until it crashes.
5) GDB will detect the crash and freeze the plugin again. Use 'bt' to
   print a nice backtrace. Report the issue to the Xfce bugtracker at
   https://bugzilla.xfce.org, providing the backtrace.
6) 'quit' exits the debugger.
