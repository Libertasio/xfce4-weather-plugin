"Named after the astronomer Anders Celsius who invented the original scale in 1742, the Celsius scale is an international standard unit and nowadays defined using the Kelvin scale. 0 °C is equivalent to 273.15 K and 1 °C difference in temperature is exactly the same difference as 1 K. It is defined with the melting point of water being roughly at 0 °C and its boiling point at 100 °C at one standard atmosphere (1 atm = 1013.5 hPa). Until 1948, the unit was known as <i>centigrade</i> - from Latin <i>centum</i> (100) and <i>gradus</i> (steps).\n"
"In meteorology and everyday life the Celsius scale is very convenient for expressing temperatures because its numbers can be an easy indicator for the formation of black ice and snow."
msgstr "天文學家安德斯·攝爾修斯在1742年發明了原始的攝式溫標，攝式溫標是現今的國際標準單位，並被用來定義熱力學溫標。0 °C 相當於273.15 K 且1 °C 的刻度與1 K相同。它被定義為，在一大氣壓(一大氣壓 = 1013.5百帕)下，水的熔點大約是0 °C，而沸點則是100 °C。直到1948年，此單位被稱為 <i>攝氏度</i> ─ 來自拉丁文的 <i>centum</i> (100)及 <i>gradus</i> (度)。\n在氣象學及日常生活中，攝氏溫標用來表示溫度非常方便，因為它的數值可以簡單的作為薄冰和雪形成的指標。"

"The current Fahrenheit temperature scale is based on one proposed in 1724 by the physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. 0 °F was the freezing point of brine on the original scale at standard atmospheric pressure, which was the lowest temperature achievable with this mixture of ice, salt and ammonium chloride. The melting point of water is at 32 °F and its boiling point at 212 °F. The Fahrenheit and Celsius scales intersect at -40 degrees. Even in cold winters, the temperatures usually do not fall into negative ranges on the Fahrenheit scale.\n"
"With its inventor being a member of the Royal Society in London and having a high reputation, the Fahrenheit scale enjoyed great popularity in many English-speaking countries, but was replaced by the Celsius scale in most of these countries during the metrification process in the mid to late 20th century."
msgstr "現今的華氏溫標是基於在1724年由物理學家丹尼爾·加布里埃爾·華倫海特所提出的溫標。0 °F 在原始的華氏溫標下曾是冰點，這是由冰，鹽和氯化銨在一大氣壓下混合所得到的最低溫度。水的凝固點是32 °F ，而沸點則是212 °F。華氏溫標和攝氏溫標會在-40度處相交。即使是在寒冷的冬天，華氏溫標的溫度通常也不會落入負值的範圍。\n因為它的發明者是英國皇家學會院士，有相當高的聲譽，華氏溫標在許多英語系國家中大受歡迎，但在20世紀中到晚期的改用十進制過程中被攝氏溫標逐漸的替換掉。"
