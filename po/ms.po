"Named after the astronomer Anders Celsius who invented the original scale in 1742, the Celsius scale is an international standard unit and nowadays defined using the Kelvin scale. 0 °C is equivalent to 273.15 K and 1 °C difference in temperature is exactly the same difference as 1 K. It is defined with the melting point of water being roughly at 0 °C and its boiling point at 100 °C at one standard atmosphere (1 atm = 1013.5 hPa). Until 1948, the unit was known as <i>centigrade</i> - from Latin <i>centum</i> (100) and <i>gradus</i> (steps).\n"

"The current Fahrenheit temperature scale is based on one proposed in 1724 by the physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. 0 °F was the freezing point of brine on the original scale at standard atmospheric pressure, which was the lowest temperature achievable with this mixture of ice, salt and ammonium chloride. The melting point of water is at 32 °F and its boiling point at 212 °F. The Fahrenheit and Celsius scales intersect at -40 degrees. Even in cold winters, the temperatures usually do not fall into negative ranges on the Fahrenheit scale.\n"
"With its inventor being a member of the Royal Society in London and having a high reputation, the Fahrenheit scale enjoyed great popularity in many English-speaking countries, but was replaced by the Celsius scale in most of these countries during the metrification process in the mid to late 20th century."
