- Fix adjusting label text size to panel size.
- Fix scrollbox scroll direction in vertical mode.
- Major rewrite: Migrate to yr.no API instead of weather.com (bug #8105)
  The plugin now uses data from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute,
  which is a bit different now and forced a redesign of the summary
  window and more logic for computing the values.
  This rewrite means the hassle with the expiring license keys is finally
  gone, and the plugin shouldn't stop working suddenly, as API changes
  are announced quite some time before they become active.
  Forecasts for up to 10 days are provided, depending on the location.
  The location is defined by latitude and longitude, the actual name
  is only used for presentation.
- Switch to the new GeoIP service at geoip.xfce.org, the old one has
  stopped working correctly quite some time ago.
- Automatically set system of measurement depending on the GeoIP
  country code.
- Fix wrong location search results (bug #8832).
- Enlarge the search dialog. It's now capable of showing 10 or more
  results instead of only 2 or 3.
- Nice error message in summary window when no location was set or
  when there's no data available.
- Make left click toggle the forecast window (bug #8805)
- Optimized update intervals (downloading data and presentation).
  This should also fix update issues after suspend/resume.
- Add move label up/down buttons to config dialog.
